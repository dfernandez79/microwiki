Introduction

Microwiki is a minimalist wiki server to be used to add
documentation to software projects.

Some of the characteristics of microwiki are:

* No databases, pages are stored in files using [Markdown][1] format, and you
   can edit them directly using a text editor or your favorite IDE.

* Does not provide versioning: pages are stored in plain files, that let's you use
   SVN, GIT or your favorite SCM system.

*  No configuration needed: start microwiki in your document folder and you are
   done.
