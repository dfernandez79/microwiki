Introduction
============

Microwiki is not a normal Wiki Server, and istead of "Wiki" it could be called "doc viewer" or something like 
that but I wasn't in a creative day for names.

To explain what is microwiki, is better to start with the tool goals:

* Make easy to share your project documentation, without the need of a CMS.
* Make the documentation available with your source code.
* Use your current versioning system to store your project documentation.
* Use of your current tools (text editor / IDE) to edit the documentation.
* Make easy to view and browse the documentation.

The tipical use case of microwiki will look something like this:

* Checkout your project
* Start microwiki, and use your web browser to browse the docs in your project/docs folders
  
  - In microwiki you can search, view and edit your docs
  - The changes are stored back to your project/docs folder as plain text files, so you can use a text editor 
    to view/edit them
* Then you can commit/merge your changes, so other developers can see them
